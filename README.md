# GOing-Hunting
A dirty little bash wrapper around some external recon tools with some scope checking in place. 

Usage: ./GOing-Hunting.sh domain/url path/to/scope/file

Nmap will not work unless you provide a scope file as typically active scanning is frowned upon. 

Space seperation is fine. 

Thanks to Tomnomnom / Haccer / Sensepost for the heavy lifting.
